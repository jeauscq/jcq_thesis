# Control System for Safe and Optimal Trajectory Execution in Robots

This repository contains the code and simulation framework developed for the thesis _"Control System for Safe and Optimal Trajectory Execution in Robots."_ The project proposes a novel learning-based controller that enables safe and efficient execution of robot trajectories under physical constraints using a combination of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

## Overview

This work presents a learning-based control framework for torque-driven robotic manipulators operating under physical constraints. The proposed system is trained using an innovative approach that combines Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The learned policy is shaped to imitate reference trajectories generated by a Model Predictive Controller (MPC), ensuring safety and efficiency.

The architecture integrates complementary mechanisms to enforce physical constraints, such as torque and velocity limits, and is designed for robust generalization across multiple scenarios.

The system is evaluated on a planar 2-DoF robot with realistic actuation limits. Performance is assessed based on:

- Mean and standard deviation of position and velocity tracking errors
- Inference time and variability
- Constraint violation metrics

The results demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves inference times over **17× faster** than the MPC baseline, enabling real-time deployment with minimal computational resources. It offers a competitive and practical alternative to classical model-based approaches in scenarios requiring **fast**, **safe**, and **generalizable** control.
